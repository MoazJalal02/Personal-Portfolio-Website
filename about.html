                        Hi, I'm Rami ðŸ‘‹ I'm a second-year Software Engineering student at Universiti Teknologi Malaysia, aspiring to become a full-stack developer. I'm currently focused on learning app developmentâ€”both mobile and webâ€”and deepening my understanding of modern web frameworks. I work with several programming languages including C, C++, Python, and Java, as well as front-end technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I also have a basic understanding of SQL and databases. My current goals revolve around improving my skills in full-stack and app development, with a strong interest in building scalable applications. Beyond coding, I'm passionate about understanding systemsâ€”both technical and socialâ€”and I enjoy exploring topics like economics, politics, and lifelong learning.
